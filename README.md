# Tetris Block Guessing Game

# Overview

In this project, I wanted to get more familiar with Python and numpy.

I made a game that will randomly choose a Tetris block out of an array of three, then allows the player to guess which block comes next. 

Debug mode will let you see what the next block is before it is asked.

I used PyCharm as my IDE to create this software.

I used Python, numpy, and termcolor for this software.
